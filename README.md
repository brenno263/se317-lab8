# se317-lab8
Lab 8 for se317. This one's in a git repo because I'll be doing it collaboratively.

This project is to make a calculator using the MVC pattern. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out, but less than happy with the nature of the assignment itself.
The many rules about how entry should be handled and numbers should be truncated and such to make it better match a simpilistic handheld calculator were unhelpful. They complicated what I believe to be the easiest part - entering numbers - and only made the tool more difficult to use.

That's ok though, I got a decent grade on this, and I think the swing UI looks pretty good if dated.
